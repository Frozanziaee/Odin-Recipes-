            <p class="description">
                Bolani is a stuffed flatbread from the Afghan cuisine.
                It is usually filled with a mix of potatoes, 
                cilantro, and green peppers, but it can also be filled with pumpkin,
                red lentils, or chives. It is usually served with a green chutney and enjoyed as a side dish,
                or as a snack with a cup of tea.
